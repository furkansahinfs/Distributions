Monte Carlo Simulations - Continuous

This week, an example implementation is given for both the inverse transformation and the sample rejection method using two different random variables Y and X, respectively. Please, check the example script carefully.

In this assignment, you are expected to implement the rejection method for Y and the inverse transformation method for X.

- For Y, plot the pdf of the distribution.

- For X, plot the cdf of the distribution.

- For both Y and X, plot the histogram and the cumulative sum of histogram values of the generated samples.
