Method of Moments

When estimating distribution parameters from a sample using method of moments, sometimes (non-central) moments are not usable or enough to make the estimation. In that case, central moments help to find an answer. This assignment illustrates this case:

Random variable X is known to have binomial distribution. 

Generate samples of size N from X by simulating the binomial experiment where 40 (n) trials are done with probability of success being 0.3 (p).
Estimate the binomial distribution parameters from the generated sample by using method of moments (1st moment and 2nd central moment).
For N=200, 800 and 3200, repeat the experiment 1000 times and plot the distribuiton of the estimated parameters on two figures, one for each parameter.
